Getting Started
===============

Todd Zimmerman put together `a very nice tutorial`_ on getting started with
``manim``, which has been updated to run on python 3.7. Note that you'll want
to change `from big_ol_pile_of_manim_imports import *` to `from
manimlib.imports import *` to work with the current codebase.
